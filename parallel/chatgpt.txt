Create a program in Python according to this specification:
- Include a main function.
- Create an output folder if it doesn't exist.
- Delete all txt files inside the output folder.
- Read a CSV named /workspaces/chatGPT-experiments/parallel/input.csv.
- The first column is a URL and the second parameter is a body. The file contains a header.
- The separator is a comma.
- Store the values in a queue.
- Create three threads. 
- Whle there are elements in the queue each thread will take an item from the queue and send a POST request with the URL and body.
- Each thread should create a txt response file and log the results appending.
- Use asyncio.
