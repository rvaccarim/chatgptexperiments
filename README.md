# ChatGPT experiments

This repository contains some small utilities that were generated using ChatGPT.  

Basically, I wanted to test scenarios that are fairly common, for instance:
- Dealing with logs, files and directories.
- Using external packages.
- Consuming APIs.
- Storing data in a database.
- Processing a CSV file.
- Using multiple threads.

If you are interested, you can read about it on my [blog](https://robertovaccari.com/blog/2023_10_24_chatgpt_experiments).
